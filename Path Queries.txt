Prequisites:
- DFS
- Euler Tour - Tree traversal array
- Range Sum / Point Update Queries

Approach :
- Updating a node's value in the tree means updating its value in the tree traversal array in all its positions (here two positions : in the first and last positions of the node's subtree subarray)
- The sum from nodes's values from the root to any node is equal to the sum of the prefix values ending at the first position of that node.
--> Need of Segment Tree (My choice) or Fenwick Tree
Let's note the first position of node in tree traversal array as l[node], and the second position as r[node].
--> First Type Query (1, node, val) :
	Update seg[l[node]] by val
	Update seg[r[node]] by -val
--> Second Type Query (2, node) :
	Output the result of the segment tree query from 1 to l[node]
